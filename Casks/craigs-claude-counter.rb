  caveats <<~EOS
    Craig's Claude Counter reads usage from the local engine (the small Node
    server in the repo). Start it so the app + widget show live data:

      git clone https://github.com/CraigVG/craigs-claude-counter
      cd craigs-claude-counter && npm start

    Then add the desktop widget: right-click the desktop > Edit Widgets >
    search "Claude Counter".
